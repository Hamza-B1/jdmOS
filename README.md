# jdmOS

This is a minimal OS I have "made" for my own learning experience. It targets the x86_64 platform. It uses a monolithic kernel (for now).
## Features

## To-do
- Shell
- Keyboard Driver
- Calculator App
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Text Editor
## Build Instructions
I have included a shell script to install the required build tools (cross compiler etc.)
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/x86_64elfgcc/bin
